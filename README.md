This notebook performs classification and regression tasks using both classical features and LLM-derived embeddings to predict phage-host interaction strength. Two models are evaluated: XGBoost and Random Forest.

LLM-based features are derived following the approach from PhageHostLearn.

Classical features are based on methods from the PHIAF study (implemented in a separate notebook).
